; The database section defines access to the administration DB
; 
; Current development relies on SQLite for the admin DB and
; the parameters are the path to the SQLite file and the PDO
; connection string for the SQLite DB.  User and password are
; not currently used, and are included only in case a different
; database might be used in future.

; The logging section controls how the API will log information
; 
; The directory is for the API's own log.  If it is provided and
; directory specified is writeable, then the API will write an
; access log called api.log into the specified directory.
; The error email address, if specified, will be used to notify errors.

; The API keys section provides security for the API
;
; An arbitrary number of keys can be specified.  Each key must be assigned
; to an integer, which is the API Key ID.  Corresponding to the ID is
; the actual API Key.  It can be any arbitrary string of characters - a
; convenient way to create meaningless keys is to take the MD5 hash of some
; random text.
;
; Each piece of software that uses the API should have its own ID and key.
