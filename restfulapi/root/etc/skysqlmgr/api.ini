; 
; Current development relies on SQLite for the admin DB and

; The shell section configures how shell commands will run. It contains
; a path, which indicates the location of the RunCommand.sh script that

; The API also needs to know where to find the PHP executable in 
; order to know how to implement scheduled commands.

; Monitor defaults determines how many readings and what intervals the

; are specified in the request.  The interval is in seconds.  The
; defaults indicate that a total of 15 values will be returned, each
; one covering a period of half an hour, covering a total of 7.5 hours.

; The debug section allows options to aid in development of API clients
;
; Showheaders can be "yes", in which case all the headers sent by the API in
;  the response will also be included in the body of the response as a 
;  property "responseheaders"
; Reflectheaders can be "yes", in which case all responses will include a
;  property "requestheaders" that is an object with properties and values corresponding
;  to the headers received in the request.
; Showhttpcode can be "yes", in which case the HTTP result code will always
;  be included as a property of the response.

; The API keys section provides security for the API
;
; An arbitrary number of keys can be specified.  Each key must be assigned
; to an integer, which is the API Key ID.  Corresponding to the ID is
; the actual API Key.  It can be any arbitrary string of characters - a
; convenient way to create meaningless keys is to take the MD5 hash of some
; random text.
;
; Each piece of software that uses the API should have its own ID and key.
